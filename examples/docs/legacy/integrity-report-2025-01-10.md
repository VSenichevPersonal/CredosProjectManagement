**Indexes Created:** 30+

Key indexes:
- ✅ idx_control_measures_tenant_org
- ✅ idx_control_measures_tenant_locked
- ✅ idx_users_tenant_org_role
- ✅ idx_compliance_records_unique (UNIQUE)
- ✅ idx_requirements_code_tenant_unique (UNIQUE)

- ✅ suggested_control_measure_template_ids
- ✅ recommended_evidence_type_ids

### 7. Data Integrity Constraints ✅

| Constraint | Status | Implementation |
|------------|--------|----------------|
| Unique compliance records | ✅ PASS | UNIQUE(requirement_id, organization_id, tenant_id) |
| Unique requirement codes | ✅ PASS | UNIQUE(code, tenant_id) |
| Evidence link target check | ✅ PASS | CHECK(control_measure_id IS NOT NULL OR requirement_id IS NOT NULL) |
| Relevance score range | ✅ PASS | CHECK(relevance_score BETWEEN 1 AND 5) |

## Known Issues

### ~~Critical Issues~~ ✅ RESOLVED

#### ~~1. RLS Policies Using JWT Claims~~ ✅ FIXED

**Issue:** RLS policies were checking `auth.jwt() ->> 'tenant_id'` but JWT doesn't contain custom fields

**Impact:** HIGH - Blocked all measure creation operations

**Resolution:** Script 580 changed all policies to query `users` table directly using `auth.uid()`

**Fixed In:** scripts/580_fix_rls_use_users_table.sql

**Date:** 2025-01-10

---

### Minor Issues (Non-Critical)

#### 1. Data Population Gaps ⚠️

**Issue:** Many requirements lack suggested_control_measure_template_ids

**Impact:** Low - System works in flexible mode, but strict mode cannot be used

**Recommendation:** Create seeding script to populate templates for all requirements

**Priority:** Medium

#### 2. Duplicate Junction Tables ℹ️

**Issue:** Both `evidence_links` and `control_measure_evidence` tables exist

**Impact:** None - Only `evidence_links` is used in current implementation

**Recommendation:** Remove `control_measure_evidence` table or consolidate

**Priority:** Low

#### 3. Missing Admin UI ⚠️

**Issue:** No UI for managing control_measure_templates

**Impact:** Medium - Templates must be managed via SQL

**Recommendation:** Build admin interface for template management

**Priority:** High

---

## Recommendations

### ~~Immediate Actions (Priority: High)~~ ✅ COMPLETED

1. ~~**Run RLS Fix Script**~~ ✅ COMPLETED
   \`\`\`bash
   psql -f scripts/580_fix_rls_use_users_table.sql
   \`\`\`
   This fixes the critical JWT claims issue.

### Short-Term Actions (Priority: Medium)

1. **Seed Template Data**
   Create script to populate suggested_control_measure_template_ids for all requirements.

2. **Add Bulk Operations**
   Implement API endpoints for:
   - Bulk-assign requirements to organizations
   - Bulk-create measures from templates
   - Bulk-link evidence to measures

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   Set up monitoring for:
   - RLS policy execution time
   - Status calculation trigger performance
   - Query optimization opportunities

### Long-Term Actions (Priority: Low)

1. **Consolidate Junction Tables**
   Decide on single junction table approach and migrate data.

2. **Add Audit Trail**
   Enhance audit_log to track:
   - Measure status changes
   - Evidence link changes
   - Template modifications

3. **Implement Caching**
   Add caching layer for:
   - User context lookups
   - Organization hierarchy checks
   - Template recommendations
