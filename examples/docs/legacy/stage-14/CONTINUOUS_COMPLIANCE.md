# Continuous Compliance Model

## Overview

Continuous Compliance is a modern approach to regulatory compliance that replaces periodic audits with real-time monitoring and evidence collection.

## Traditional vs Continuous Compliance

### Traditional Approach (Stage 13)
\`\`\`
1. Requirement defined
2. Due date set (e.g., annual audit)
3. Evidence collected before deadline
4. Audit performed
5. Status: Pass/Fail
6. Repeat next year
\`\`\`

**Problems:**
- Compliance is binary (pass/fail)
- Evidence collection is rushed before deadline
- No visibility between audits
- Reactive, not proactive

### Continuous Approach (Stage 14)
\`\`\`
1. Requirement defined
2. Control measures specified
3. Evidence collected continuously
4. Status calculated in real-time
5. Always audit-ready
\`\`\`

**Benefits:**
- Compliance is continuous (0-100%)
- Evidence collected as it's created
- Real-time visibility
- Proactive risk management

## Implementation

### 1. No Due Dates

Compliance records don't have `due_date`. Instead:
- Status is calculated from evidence presence
- Organizations are always "in compliance" or "working towards compliance"
- No artificial deadlines

### 2. Real-Time Status

Status is calculated automatically:
\`\`\`typescript
// Measure level
measure.status = (evidence_count >= required_count) ? 'completed' : 'pending'

// Compliance record level
record.status = all_measures_completed ? 'compliant' : 'in_progress'

// Requirement level (across all orgs)
requirement.compliance_rate = compliant_orgs / total_orgs
\`\`\`

### 3. Evidence Reusability

One document can prove multiple controls:
\`\`\`
Приказ о назначении ответственного.pdf
  ├─ Proves: "Назначить ответственного за ИБ"
  ├─ Proves: "Утвердить политику ИБ"
  └─ Proves: "Определить полномочия"
\`\`\`

This reduces burden on organizations.

### 4. Flexible vs Strict Modes

**Strict Mode:**
- Only predefined measures allowed
- Ensures consistency across organizations
- Used for critical requirements (e.g., FSTEC Category 1)

**Flexible Mode:**
- Organizations can add custom measures
- Allows adaptation to specific context
- Used for general requirements

## User Workflows

### Administrator Workflow
1. Define requirement
2. Select suggested control measure templates
3. Set measure_mode (flexible/strict)
4. Assign to organizations
5. Monitor compliance in real-time

### Executor Workflow
1. Receive assigned compliance record
2. See required control measures
3. Upload evidence for each measure
4. Evidence automatically linked
5. Status updates in real-time

### Auditor Workflow
1. View compliance dashboard
2. See real-time status across all orgs
3. Drill down to specific requirements
4. Review evidence for each measure
5. Export compliance report

## Benefits for Russian Regulatory Context

### FSTEC Compliance
- Requirement hierarchy matches FSTEC structure
- Evidence types align with FSTEC documentation requirements
- Continuous monitoring supports ongoing certification

### FSB Requirements
- Real-time visibility into security posture
- Evidence of continuous compliance
- Audit trail for all changes

### Roskomnadzor
- Personal data protection measures tracked
- Evidence of technical and organizational measures
- Ready for inspections at any time

## Metrics

### Compliance Rate
\`\`\`
compliance_rate = compliant_orgs / total_orgs
\`\`\`

### Evidence Coverage
\`\`\`
evidence_coverage = measures_with_evidence / total_measures
\`\`\`

### Time to Compliance
\`\`\`
time_to_compliance = days_from_assignment_to_compliant
\`\`\`

### Evidence Reuse Rate
\`\`\`
reuse_rate = evidence_links / total_evidence
\`\`\`

## Future Enhancements

1. **Automated Evidence Collection**
   - Integration with monitoring systems
   - Automatic screenshot capture
   - Log aggregation

2. **Predictive Analytics**
   - Predict compliance gaps
   - Recommend evidence based on similar orgs
   - Alert before non-compliance

3. **Approval Workflows**
   - Evidence review and approval
   - Multi-level sign-off
   - Rejection with feedback

4. **Notifications**
   - Alert when evidence expires
   - Notify when new measures added
   - Remind about incomplete measures
